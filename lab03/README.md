Solution:

I added additional tests to DateTest.java to improve coverage for class Date. To verify my solution, you can compile DateTest.java using the provided Jupiter JAR file in the library and then running the compiled DateTest class to view the test results. Despite these additions, the overall test coverage remained the same as before.
