In your own words explain what the various mutations are doing and what the report tells you: 
The PIT Test Coverage Report shows 100% line and mutation coverage for the 'calculator' class, meaning all lines and mutation points were successfully tested. Specifically, five lines and eight mutation points were covered, ensuring the tests can detect errors.

Explain what it means for a mutant to be killed:
In mutation testing, a mutant is a deliberately altered version of the code with a small error, like a changed operator or variable. A mutant is "killed" if the test suite detects the change and fails, showing the tests are effective. If the tests pass despite the mutation, the mutant is "alive," indicating the test suite isn't thorough enough to catch that error.
